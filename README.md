Monster Hunter World Steamworks button masher bot.

My fingers started to hurt from mashing AWD for too long, so here is a bot that spams for you.

- spams a selection of A, W, D
- also spams SPACE to restart steamworks
- start/pause script with C and go afk

- skipping the cutscene is not possible, it requires to press the >>back<< button and that exits the steamworks when spammed

This might be caught as a keylogger by your anti virus software. Why? Because it is logging keystrokes. Makes sense, right? But hear me out... in order to start/stop the script by pressing a button ('C'), I'm constantly checking if 'C' was pressed. Which is apparently suspicious to some anti virus programs.
