Monster Hunter World Steamworks button masher bot.

My fingers started to hurt from mashing AWD for too long, here is a bot that spams for you.

- really unoptimized, just spams random keys
- terrible code, ripped mostly from a different project
- time investment: about 20 minutes
- but it works so don't blame me

bugs:

pressing x does something not good, it was supposed to close the script but instead it just hangs and the console window stays open.
fix: close console and restart script
